Prestazo was built as a Paid app. This SERVICE is provided by Reynaldo Sánchez Hernández at a cost of 5 USD and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

## Information Collection and Use
Prestazo is a completely local application. It does not use cloud services or external servers to store your data.

All information regarding your loans, clients, and payments is stored exclusively on your device.

As the developer, I do not have access to, collect, or store any of the data you enter into the app.

## Backup and Data Responsibility
The app includes a backup feature to help you preserve your information.

**User Responsibility:** The user is solely responsible for choosing a secure location (such as local storage or their own personal cloud accounts) to save these backup files.

**Data Loss:** As the developer and owner of Prestazo, Reynaldo Sánchez Hernández is not responsible for any loss of information. Since the data is stored locally and never reaches a server under my control, the user is the sole owner and manager of their information.

**Restoration:** It is the user's responsibility to manage and keep their backup files safe to perform a restoration when desired.

## Log Data
I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app, I collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

## Cookies
This Service does not use "cookies". The app does not use any third party code or libraries that use "cookies" to collect information.

## Service Providers
I do not employ third-party companies or individuals to facilitate my Service, to provide the Service on my behalf, to perform Service-related services, or to assist me in analyzing how my Service is used.

## Security
I value your trust. Since Prestazo operates locally, your data's security depends on your device's security. I recommend using device encryption and secure backup locations to protect your information.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. These changes are effective as of December 25, 2025.
